# Julia Floating-Point Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Julia (and other languages) involving floating-point comparisons. The `myfunction` in `bug.jl` attempts to handle positive, zero, and negative inputs. However, it can fail if the input is a very small, non-zero number that might be considered 'close enough' to zero.

The solution provided in `bugSolution.jl` shows how to mitigate this issue using an approach that considers a tolerance range around zero.
